# Automated Inventory & Costing Calculator (Google Sheets)

## Project Overview
This project showcases an automated, scalable solution built entirely within Google Sheets for a client in the **beverage and events industry**. The goal was to solve a complex data consolidation and inventory management challenge, transforming a manual, time-consuming process into an efficient, two-click solution.

## The Challenge
The client's critical operational data was spread across more than 20 separate, inconsistently formatted files. This made it impossible to generate accurate, line-item inventory lists for events, requiring hours of manual, error-prone data entry and reconciliation.

## The Solution
I designed and built a multi-tab Google Sheet application that fully automates the process. The tool features a centralized "database" tab for recipes and a dynamic "calculator" tab. It allows the user to select an event type from a dropdown menu, input a guest count, and instantly receive a complete inventory and costing report.

## Key Features & Skills Demonstrated
* **Scalable Data Structure:** Designed a database tab for recipes and ingredients that can be easily updated by non-technical users.
* **Dynamic User Interface:** Created a user-friendly calculator tab with error-proof inputs using **Data Validation** (dropdowns and number validation).
* **Advanced Formulas:** Utilized a combination of **`FILTER`**, **`ARRAYFORMULA`**, and **`REGEXEXTRACT`** to handle messy source data and perform complex, automatic lookups and calculations.
* **Business Intelligence:** The final output provides a clear, actionable inventory list and cost-per-event summary, turning raw data into a valuable decision-making tool.

## Business Impact
This solution **saved the client dozens of hours** of manual data entry per month, **eliminated costly data errors**, and provided them with a reliable tool to accurately forecast inventory needs for their events.# Automated-Inventory-Spreadsheet
